## Secure Against What?

> **Anything insecure is what necessarily uncontrolled,**\
> **Everything is secure necessarily controlled**

### The pain of insecurity:
- Somebody knows something you wish 
- Interception
- We most segregate who know stuff and who don't
- And segregate those who can do staff from those who cant
- Exess previllage
- Two pillars of security
- Provenance - where (and who) something came from

### Encoding, Decoding and Serialization
- **Encoding**: The process of converting message in ordinary language, or other information into a secret form that cannot be interpreted without knowing the secret method for interpretation, called the key.
